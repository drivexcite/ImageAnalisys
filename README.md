# ImageAnalisys

This is a simple project that demonstrates without ceremony how to use Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision) to extract image metadata from a FileStream and a random URL.

The model also includes a simple SQL schema to store this information in a semi-structured way (JSON column with JPath queries).
